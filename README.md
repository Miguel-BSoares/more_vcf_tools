## ðŸ”§ More tools ðŸ”§ ##

In this repository will can find some tools that I am and will be currently developing to retrieve specific information from vcf files.

The constant need to customize existing tools led me to try and engage myself into tool production. I chose Python because it is language I feel more confortable using.

At the moment, the focus is on integrating outputs of vcf files with external databases. 

DISCLAIMER:
All the programs in *more_vcf_tools* have been built and optimized with the help of AI :robot:
